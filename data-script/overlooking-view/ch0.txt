One day, I chose to take the main street home.
This was unusual for me, just a whim of the moment.
Walking along the building-lined street that I was tired of seeing day in and day out, someone came crashing down.
I hardly even had a chance to hear it. The muffled splattering sound.
But it was obvious: someone had fallen from one of the buildings above... and was now dead.
A crimson color slowly seeped onto the concrete.
Only the long black hair still retained its former appearance. Thin, fragile, white-looking limbs. And a lifeless, smashed face.
The whole scene reminded me of a pressed flower, flattened between the old pages of a book.

Probably because the corpse, with only its neck bent like a fetus, looked like a folded lily to me.
