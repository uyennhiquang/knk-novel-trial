One day, I chose to take the main street home.
This was unusual for me, just a whim of the moment.
Walking along the building-lined street that I was tired of seeing day in and day out, someone came crashing down.
I hardly even had a chance to hear it. The muffled splattering sound.
But it was obvious: someone had fallen from one of the buildings above ... and was now dead.
A crimson color slowly seeped onto the concrete.
Only the long black hair still retained its former appearance. Thin, fragile, white-looking limbs. And a lifeless, smashed face.
The whole scene reminded me of a pressed flower, flattened between the old pages of a book. I guess. Probably.
Only because the corpse, its neck twisted into a fetal position, looked to me like a folded lily.
I knew who the person was.
In the end, Hypnos, or sleep, had, after all, become Thanatos ... death.
Ignoring the gathering crowd of onlookers, I was walking away when I heard a pattering sound, and Azaka caught up with me.
"That was a jumping suicide, wasn't it, Touko-san?"
"Yeah, looks like it," I replied vaguely. To be honest, I didn't really have any interest.
Whatever the victim's decision had been, a suicide was only treated as a suicide in the end.
That girl's final act of will hadn't been summed up by the word fly, or even floaty but rather fall. The only thing in that act had been vain futility. There was no need for me to pay it any attention.
"I heard there were a lot last year," said Azaka. "Maybe suicide's coming back into fashion? But I don't understand people who kill themselves. Do you, Miss Toko?"
I nodded another vague "yes."
I looked up at the sky and answered, as though gazing at an impossible vision.
"There's no meaning in suicide. She probably just couldn't fly today. That's all."
