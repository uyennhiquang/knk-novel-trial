When I was little, I once cut my hand while playing house.
Among those borrowed things, imitated things, fabricated things...
A real one was mixed in with all those cooking utensils.
While I was playing with this well-crafted knife,
I at some point made a deep cut between the fingers.
When I returned to my mother with my hand red and painful,
I remember her scolding me, then crying, and then kindly embracing me.
It must have hurt a lot, she said.
I was happy, not because of those words that I did not understand,
But because I was happier about the fact that mother embraced me, so I started crying with her.
Fujino, the pain will go away once the cut heals...
Mother said so as she covered the wound with bandages.
I did not know what those words meant...
Because not even once did I feel any pain.
